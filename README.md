# Inclusivity Training

## What will I find here?

A repository of resources to form a curriculum for better understanding oppression and racism, to place anyone in a position of power in better stead to be positive contributors to the inclusivity and diversity movement.

## How will this work?

Issues will be aimed at specific learning points, and act as a nexus for helpful resources, commentary, and discussion.

I welcome you to get involved in the conversation. Before doing so, **please refer to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/npscience/inclusivity-training/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

**I particularly encourage anyone who has felt oppressed by major powers, however you identify, to take part in these conversations.** 
In return, I will enforce the code of conduct in this repository. What that means practically is that I vouch to stand up and call out any oppressive actions or behaviours publicly. I will need the community's help. Please join me in enforcing this (see issue #2). 

**If you are a person in a position of power, your job here is to listen and to learn.** Please take that onboard, and think twice before speaking over someone, or dominating any conversation. Key point: we all strive for excellence here.

## I would like to contribute

Do you have any resources, comments, guidance to offer? For now, before there's an official contributing.md, please do **share any resources by creating a new issue (preferably)** or you can send links anonymously via twitter or gitter @npscience.

## What's the back story?

Firstly, I've done this for myself primarily. I need it. And I think you might do too (probably).

I work for a node in the open science movement. One of the principles of that movement is to be 'radically inclusive', to be open in order to allow many voices to participate in the conversation of science, for everyone's benefit. We have some big problems to address: from climate change, to ageing, to better understanding human behaviour and how different societies operate. A lazy summary of the benefit of openness: teenagers can develop new ideas for therapeutics after reading open access artices; the internet can enable mass participation in research to understand ourselves and the world around us better; we get further faster when together.

I have been thinking for a whle about what I can do to ensure I am not (however subconsciously) abusing my own position to further contribute to inequality. I have access to resources, opportunities, money. I'm the primary gateway to some of these. And I spend most of my time speaking to white males. Perhaps that's symptomatic of the science and technology world in general, but I'm sure I can do better than this.

I have the pleasure of being close friends with someone who works in science communication in the UK, someone who has this year stood up and questioned practises within her own organisation. She's brave and she's used her position to bring about change. She's also taken the hit for using her own experiences to demonstrate why it's not ok for the conversation to be dominated by or exclusively conducted by only one type of person. We've spoken several times about the energy it takes for her to stand up as a BAME representative in sci-comms. I want to help where I can. She's a leader.

When I noticed thoughts externalised by a colleague in the open movemen, I joined in (with my white voice, of course). I am grateful that she helped me engage further in this conversation. It was illuminating. I made classic mistakes. She was kind, thoughtful and welcoming. And so, here is the beginning of what I hope might become a useful, welcoming, and challenging (especially) resource for my own self-improvement. If it helps others too, even better.

## The word inclusivity is a problem in itself, why have you named this inclusivity-training?

Simple answer is that this is aimed at white people. White people understand the word inclusivity. It softens the blow. Whether you think that is right or not, I am open ears. Check out issue #1 and feel free to explore this further there.
