# inclusivity-training

## What will I find here?

A repository of resources to form a curriculum for better understanding oppression, racism, and the inclusivity/diversity movement.

I plan to make each resource it's own issue, to allow people to build up reactions, comments, learning notes, and conversation around each resource. Maybe this will evolve into individual issues being about specific learning points.

I welcome you to get involved in the conversation. **I particularly encourage anyone who has felt oppressed by major powers, however you identify, to take part in these conversations.** In return, I will enforce the code of conduct in this repository. If you are a person in a position of power, your job here is to listen and to learn. Please take that onboard, and think twice before speaking over someone, or dominating any conversation. Key point: we all strive for excellence here.

## Why does this exist?

Firstly, I've done this for myself primarily. I need it. And I think you might do too (probably).

I work for a node in the open science movement. One of the principles of that movement is to be 'radically inclusive', to be open in order to allow many voices to the conversation of science. Stories of teenagers developing new therapeutics after reading open access artices, of the internet enabling mass participation in research to understand ourselves and the world around us better.

I have been thinking for a whle about what I can do to ensure I am not (however unconsciously) abusing my own position to further contribute to inequality. I have access to resources, opportunities, money. I'm the primary gateway. And I spend most of my time speaking to white males. Perhaps that's symptomatic of the science and technology world in general, but I'm sure I can do better than this.

I have the pleasure of calling a friend someone who works in science communication in the UK, and has this year stood up and questioned practises within her own organisation. She's brave, but she's also been well-placed to do this. She's used her own experiences to demonstrate why it's not ok for the conversation to be dominated by or exclusivley conducted by only one type of person. We've spoken several times about the energy it takes for her to stand up as a BAME representative in sci-comms.

Today, I noticed thoughts externalised by a colleague in the open movement, and am grateful that she helped me engage further in this conversation. It was illuminating. I made classic mistakes. She was kind, thoughtful and welcoming.

## I think people need this and I have some great resources to add (aka Contributing)

For now, before there's official contributing.md, please do share any resources via issue #1 or via twitter or gitter @npscience

## The word inclusivity is a problem in itself, why have you named this inclusivity-training?

Simple answer is that this is aimed at white people. White people understand the word inclusivity. It softens the blow. Whether you think that is right or not, I am open ears. Check out issue #2 and feel free to explore this further there.
